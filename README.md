# Data description

All used data is available in this repository in child directories of `Abs_Fluor_analysis` directory:

* `Bradford_protein_concentrations/220620_cgre_bradford.xlsx` &ndash; ...
* `Mut_robustness/data/*` &ndash; ...
* `Thermostability/data/*` &ndash; ...
* `Urea/data/*` &ndash; ...

# Code availability

All functions used for data processing and visualization are stored in `utils.py` files. The main part of data analysis and visualization can be found in corresponding jupyter notebooks.

# Usage

All code was run on **Python 3.9.7** on **Ubuntu 22.04** and **Ubuntu 20.04**. Correct work on other versions is not guaranteed.

## Local running

You need `git` to be installed. Open terminal (`Crtl+Alt+t`) and run following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnnaToi01/GFP_Robustness.git
cd GFP_Robustness
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After all required libraries installation you can launch jupyter notebooks and work with chosen datasets.
